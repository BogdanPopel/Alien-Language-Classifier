# Alien-Language-Classifier
Kaggle competition, details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-2022-unibuc-23-25).

Participants have to train a model on alien text samples. Therefore, participants have to build a model for an alien language classification task, in which a classification model is required to discriminate between languages spoken by aliens on three different planets: Bellerophon (label 1), Ymir (label 2), Nanook (label 3).

The training data is composed of 15,000 samples. The validation set is composed of 5,000 samples.

The evaluation measure is the macro F1 score computed on the test set.

I scored an F1 score of 0.75652, which placed my submission 35th on the [leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-2022-unibuc-23-25/leaderboard).
